This project may be useful in teaching and learning group theory.

## Usage
see `examples` folder for some basic usage

defined in `binaryop.py`.

`group_element.py`
This file provides some concrete group elements, e.g. Integer, Permutation.

`binaryop.py`
This file provides some concrete operations, e.g. Modulo, Permute.

You can define any group, element, operation you want.
